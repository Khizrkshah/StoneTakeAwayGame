# Stone takeaway game

The following game is played by two players.

Consider 15 small boxes arranged in a line. Each box except one contains a piece of stone. (Thus, there is one empty box. When a game is started a box must be chosen to be the empty one randomly.) Players move in turn. In a move, a player must take away a stone from a box or two stones from two adjacent boxes. The winner of the game is the player who makes the last move.

When the game is started the program asks for the names of the players.

The program stored the result of the games as follows. For each game, the following information is stored: the date and time when the game was started, the name of the players, the number of moves made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner. The program displays a high score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed.

The data is stored in a JSON file.
